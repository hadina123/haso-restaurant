        Instructions:<br>
        
        <li> Cook the meat:     
            In a large pot, heat oil and sauté onions until golden.
            
            Add meat and sear until browned on all sides.
            
            Add garlic and spices; stir for a minute.
            
            Pour water, bring to a boil, then simmer (covered) for ~1.5 hours or until tender.
            
            Once cooked, remove the meat and save the broth. </li><br>
    
        
        
        <li>Prepare the rice:   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
        
            Add soaked rice and boil until it’s just shy of fully cooked (about 6–8 mins).
            
            Drain and set aside.</li><br>
        
      
        
        
        <li>Make the topping:
        
            In a pan, heat oil/butter and sauté carrots until soft.
            
            Add raisins and sugar (if using), cook until they plump.
            
            Optionally add nuts at the end for crunch.</li> <br>
        
        
        <li>Layer and steam:  In a large pot, layer some rice, then the meat, then more rice on top.
        
            Sprinkle a bit of the meat broth between layers.
            
            Make 3–4 holes with the handle of a spoon for steam to circulate.
            
            Cover the pot lid with a clean towel and seal tightly.
            
            Steam on low heat for 30–45 minutes.</li>
        
       <br>
        
        
        <li>Assemble and serve:
        
            Gently mix rice before serving, plate with meat and toppings spread over the top.
            
            Serve with salad, chutney, or yogurt on the side.</li>
